My husband and I recently received our second Pfizer vaccination at the MIND building in Sacramento.  We feel fortunate to be patients of UC Davis Medical Center. They notified us to make an appointment when it was our turn and the organization at the vaccination site was flawless.  No wasted time nor confusion anywhere along the way.  Thank you!
Miss Teal up on the 2nd floor in Optical Dept is as nice and knowledgeable as they come kudos to you for your help!! See my new glasses do they look alright??
"If I could give this hospital negative stars I would. My newborn son developed PUV, lost a kidney. Doctor who performed surgery on him did not come to see him for days. When his body started swelling with fluid, another doctor tried to tell me he had gained 3 kg in a day. When I tried to move him to UCSF so he wouldn't die, they told me I was making the biggest mistake because my son was going to be a ""long term"" case and I would be stuck with medical bills for life. Well, I didn't listen, moved him to UCSF. Doctors there figured out his complex case within hours. Saved his life. He is a happy seven year old -not a long term care patient. If I had stayed at UC Davis, I am afraid my son would have been killed due to their severe malpractice. Beware of this hospital."
Don’t be fooled by their awards and notoriety. This hospital lacks compassion and care. This was my first child.  Had epidural left in my back for over six hours after giving birth. There was no doctor available to remove it. I was left in pain. Please choose another hospital to deliver your baby. Awful awful experience.
"Very disappointing ER experience.
The room we were in was filthy not only from a lack of recent cleaning but poor long term maintenance. The guest chair was falling apart, the keyboard cover was disgusting, the linen bin was overflowing.
The bathroom hadn’t been cleaned in a while, the seat covers were out, garbage cans were over flowing, etc.

Note that this review is specific to the ER. The children’s surgery center that we were transferred to was the opposite and rather impressive."
"I got my COVID vaccination, today at UCDAVIS MEDICAL CTR located on Professional Drive in Roseville, CA. The entire process from start to finish was impeccable. Wonderful staff each step of the way."
"Working in EMS currently waiting a wall time of 5+ Hrs.
I’m surprised that for such a notoriously well respected facility they have THE MOST inefficient triaging and bed transfer system than ANY of the facilities I’ve ever been to. ED staff completely brushed off EMS waiting in the hallway and continued to tell us there was no doctors in the department at the time expedite the wall time process. Not only am I ashamed to be working with this facility but it’s truly a joke of a healthcare system. Operations have to change because a 5+ hr for a 911 ambulance is just an atrocious joke.
UC DAVIS ER has got to figure something out or hire the right people who can because this is ridiculous"
I brought my father here after he was hospitalized at our local hospital.  The doctor was amazing but he insisted that we do a MRI on my dads heart.  The doctor office called us to tell us to schedule the MRI.  I have been calling everyday for the last week.  I cannot get through to anybody and after waiting on hold for 20 minutes the system forwards me to a voicemail that is full.  I am so disappointed with this hospital after all the good things I’ve heard.  We just need somebody to schedule an appointment with us and they can’t even answer the phone.
"My Mom was in ER from Wednesday 11am until admitted on Friday at 3pm. She had already had a stroke 1 week before. She was supposed to have Surgery today, and had to fast since last night midnight. She did not get her surgery and did not get to eat until 5pm. Now they say her surgery might be tomorrow and she will fast again. So far, I have showered her twice, and changed her bedding both times myself. She never has ice in her water cup and the cleanliness of the room is less than par. Very disappointed."
"Very unprofessional people. No compassion what so ever! Untrained! My boyfriend was admitted and every time I called to check on him the front would send me to the wrong department or when I reach a nurse in charge of his room, they’re “too busy” to talk to me. How am I supposed to even know if he’s dead or alive if no one wants to explain anything?! I even called to update an emergency contact number and the nurse says,”I can’t do that bc I have other patients to attend to” Wow I mean I get that with covid, low staff etc. but it’s just utterly unprofessional! It’s like they don’t train their staff right? I’ve never been to a hospital that supposedly one of the top but so unprofessional! I have not yet see a happy face since I’ve been here! They’re all gloomy as if they hate their job! They won’t let you visit, I understand that bc of covid. However, you can’t even call to get information even if they’re dying! The only time the hospital plans to call you is if your loved one is probably already dead! Honestly ppl wanna know about their loved one is for the peace of mind! And they can’t even give you that!!!"
"Your entire emergency room staff was awesome. We were in & out quickly, and treated so good by everyone. I can't tell everyone how wonderful the entire experience was. Thank you to everyone who helped her & how you do your jobs impeccably. Bless all of you."
"About two weeks ago I was experiencing severe back pain, I could barely move, I couldn’t get comfortable, it was terrible. I went into the ER and the entire staff was amazing.
I’m no stranger to hospitals and I read the reviews on this hospital, literally scared to go but it’s where I have to go per my insurance and I knew it would be easiest for my PCP to get the information. So, despite the unhappy reviews I read the pain was too much and my fiancé took me in.
The triage staff was amazing, they tried to cheer me up and took my information quickly and efficiently. We didn’t have to wait long and I was taken to the back, they put me in a room and within 5 minutes my doctor had come in to talk to me and find out what was happening. Dr. Nwabuo, took her time and listened to everything I had to say, she was gentle doing her exam and talked to my care team immediately.
Next, I met Stephanie my nurse. When I say this woman needs an award, I mean like a giant one. She came in and I asked if my fiancé could come sit with me, she said yes and asked me if I wanted her to walk out and get him. She could see that I wasn’t comfortable laying down or sitting and asked if there was anything that may help me get more comfortable. My fiancé was starving at this point and the cafeteria was closed for the moment, she overheard us talking and brought him all kinds of snacks. They attacked my pain in every way they could, they did an MRI and we found out the source of the pain. When Dr. Nwabuo came back, she explained in detail everything that was happening and asked what I wanted to do. I loved that she gave me an option to be a part of my care. In the end, I went home instead of being admitted and saw my primary care who set me up for surgery.
I would recommend this ER to everyone, be patient and remember you’re not the only sick, injured person there and while there are a lot of bad reviews, give the team a chance to change your mind. I did and I’m so thankful and grateful for the care team I had."
"I almost died in the ER waiting for care. My appendix burst while waiting 20 hrs for emergency surgery. I’ve never been so terrified in my life. I had to scream bloody murder for a doctor and finally they did surgery.

They never called my husband. My husband couldn’t get a hold of anyone. He was terrified as well.

Even now that I’m home nobody ever called me to follow up.

I won’t be doing my follow up here. Truly a nightmare. I’m totally traumatized by the whole thing."
Dr. Elizabeth Ekpo has lied to my face about my MRI results. There are literally foreign objects in my head. She insists on looking at only 3 of the 126 images. She is covering up crime. Round objects at the back of my head. There is more.
"I will definitely pick a different hospital due to some nurses being mean. One social worker thinks she has the authority to decide what goes on.She is incredibly rude. Overall , the experience staying at this hopital  for a couple of days has been very stressful."
Worst experience I ever had in a hospital! I challenged the discharge because I am week and not feeling my best aside from ringing my bell to go to the bed pan and asking for food I was completely ignored. I told them this pain had nothing to do with chronic pain I was told I would be taken care of 5 hours later no one. I can't believe the level of incompetence in this hospital. Since it's after 5 absolutely no one is available to give me care.
The worst medical attention I’ve ever seen. My father’s surgery was rescheduled 4 times. The day of his surgery I dropped him off at noon (On an empty stomach) and received a call at 3:30 pm stating that his surgery got canceled. We live 2 hours away. No one seemed to care at all that a 60 year old sick man waited all day for nothing. My whole family had scheduled time off of work around these 4 different surgery times. This is what is considered high class medical. Thank you UC Davis for making an already stressful event even more stressful.
I would not recommend their ER to anyone needing immediate assistance. When I was admitted to the ER the phlebotomist drawing my blood was playing games on his cell phone. The ER doctor's lack of thoroughness left me feeling unsure. I went to Mercy for a second opinion where I discovered I had been misdiagnosed at UCDMC. Grateful for Mercy's thoroughness and great beside manner. I will not being using any of UCDMC's services in the future given they billed me the most while providing the least amount of possible care. Overall the bedside manner was subpar.
"I really liked this place, and I thought it was good. For a full rating, it would be 3 out of 5. This was an okay hospital. Back in April, I had appendicitis and I got surgery here. The doctors said they would do my surgery on April 15th, and it was already around 9 PM on April 14th. I was relieved. Unfortunately, I do have a bone to pick with one nurse. The others were great and they treated my with care. But this one particular nurse was assigned to me, and she barely did anything with me. I was in my hospital room and it was 11 PM. My dad was with me at the time. I had to use the bathroom suddenly, and the nurse had been gone for two hours. She said she would “be right back”. And I COULD NOT MOVE. I had been hooked up to machines and I could barely shuffle off the bed. My dad got up and went to a nearby nurse to get her to unhook me so I could use the bathroom. The nurse came back half an hour later and I was angry. But this place is good and I’d go here again."
4860 Y st. Ambulatory Care. Orthopaedic dept. Best TKR surgeon ever.
Been a patient there for 12 yrs. Teaching hospital so you get MORE opinions.
"Is there a way to give a 0 on this?!?!  My husband and I waited in the ER at UC Davis for 6+ hours because he wasn’t as important of a patient as everyone else apparently. He came in with mental health issues and was trying to hurt himself and he was hurting himself in the waiting area and they did NOTHING. NOTHING, NOTHING. They said he has to wait like everybody else and that could be up to 10 hours. And they call themselves professionals."
"I have always had the best experience with the faculty at UCDAVIS excellent care
Deserve the highest rating available"
I just want to express my feelings about the doctors and nurses at UC Davis medical center.Thank you and bless you from the bottom of my heart for taking care of my brotherGbrother bless all of you.
Unbelievable they act more like a prison then a hospital
"I came to the e.r today 7/30/20 and got in right away the staff and students were awesome, I'd go back again if needed .for a tap. Thank you for your services."
"My wife was in this hospital for 2 weeks. They found out what was wrong with my wife and put together a good plan for her. Every doctor, nurse and even the housekeeping people were awesome. They seem to really care about you and how you are doing. A day or two before my wife was set to leave our son was brought in from wrecking his car. I am so glad he is there. I know he will get the best care he could get. Thank you again U C Davis for everything you people do."
I've worked with UC Davis for over 15 years and interacted with hundreds of their nurses and physicians.  I appreciate their commitment to improving their care.  I wouldn't hesitate to go their if needed.
"Switched to UC Davis Health about 1 year ago. I do pay cash because I have a private insurance and get everything reimbursed except of the 1st $500. I needed an x ray done today, they didn't take my cash and refused service. Need to go through a swamp loaded with paperwork 1st, may take up to 7 days. Hard to believe, or? No this did happen today, I call it Socialized Medicine. Where is this going to end???"
"Fantastic support, care, and professionalism from Christina in the Labor and Delivery dept floor #3. Thanks are not enough for the care and support you gave my daughter during her stay!  Baby Neal and Mary were blessed to have you as their Nurse."
"Worst emergency room in the history of medicine.  I went on March 1, 2020 and first I sat in the waiting room in pain with blood pressure (part of the reason for going) of 229/180 for 8 hours, then when was released 4 hours later still with high blood pressure being told they don't treat high blood pressure in the ER.  Was released and now even after seeing the PCM on March 3,  still have not resolved my high blood pressure which is still around 184 / 113 because they can't figure it out.  Don't go to there emergency room you'll die before you will get help."
"I've been to many hospitals in different counties and this is by far the very best hospital experience I have ever had! The staff was attentive and considerate. They listened to my needs and did their best to meet them. I was extremely pleased at how polite and caring the nurses were.. Their hospital food is the best I've ever seen. They were not trying to push me out. Their main concern was how I was feeling. I love and appreciate the Burn unit, especially RN: Kiera, RN:Jessica RN: Kristie! Thank you guys so much!"
"My son was on ER for 3-4 hours, with a pain for Urinary retention, he is unemployed has no insurance, we received a bill for 8600$ plus transportation another 2600$ Overloaded with bills we all are in shock! How can we find out if those charges are correct?? Can we please negotiate this bills, do you have any options for unemployed people, what is the best to do! Please help!"
"The absolute worst emergency room experience! My family and I called it quits after SEVEN HOURS waiting for our daughter to be treated for a possible concussion and large cut to her head requiring stitches.  During that seven hours she received no pain medication while her injury proceeded to swell and she became progressively more nauseous.  We were supposedly ""second in line"" for well over two hours.  At least two other groups of people left before us that we noticed.   We finally went to Mercy and were literally in and out in less than two hours.

Oh, and based on the online responses I've seen of other comments, I anticipate getting a boilerplate ""I'm sorry our service did not meet your expectations"" line.  Save the effort.  It means nothing."
"All the staff here care about is Hospice and they don't care about life. The ""quality of life"" is more important than actually living apparently, and the doctors are like telemarketers about Hospice. If someone says no, they continue to bring it up over and over."
Is the best hospital in Sacramento even better than Kaiser though there are some individuals there that shouldn't be.
"I had the most caring nurse in your 2nd floor ICU!!! Madison and Kendall were the bomb!!! They took excellent care of me and explained things clearly to me and my husband. I had a lot of needs during my 3 1/2 day stay, but they totally rolled with it and helped keep me calm during a very scary time!! I appreciate them so much!!! I'm glad I was airlifted there!!!"
"This place is so unorganized.  Waiting outside with the family,  can not even go in and use the restroom. The lady in the front taking people temperature was so rude.

Not"
My mother is in UC Davis hospital in downtown Sacramento and she will be dying soon the hospital won't let me see her because of Covid and I  want to see her while she can still recognize me but the hospital staff are being jerks that is why I am leaving a one star review
"The staff here have treated me so well. I'm homeless, but it doesn't matter to them. They treat me like a person, and put my health above anything else."
"UC Davis Medical Center, Is My Hospital The Hospital, Is No. 10, Great Hospital, UC Davis Hospital, Saved My Life Many Times. Thank-You!"
"I haven't been here yet, only in 6th grade, but this is my dream college. hopefully i will be able to get in with only a 42% chance of getting in."
Great care of my hubby but ya all might want to think about opening an urgent care for all the people that go to the er..that are not emergencies
"I went into UC Davis on Broadway Emergency Room back in 2006.
My jaw was broken in two places.
Needless to say the Emergency Room Doctor that was there at the time.
Looked at What X-Rays, I have no idea.
He told me There's Nothing Broken or Fractured.
Go home take Ibuprofen or Motrin for the pain.
10 day's later I went back to UC Davis on Broadway Emergency Room.
The Emergency Room Doctor had
X-Rays taken again.
He told me that my jaw was Broken in Two Places.
I had to wait for an Professional Jaw/Bone Doctor to see me.
The Professional Doctor looked at my jaw, he confirmed that my jaw was Broken in Two Places.
Then he asked me if I had Insurance, to which I replied No.
So he then told me that I have to Check myself out of the ER, catch a bus to the Primary Care on Broadway, and apply for Insurance.
Once Approved for Insurance I could come back to the ER to be seen.
While I was standing outside waiting at the bus stop for the bus.
The Doctor that found out that my jaw was Broken in Two Places, came out to the bus stop.
He told me FK that Roberta I'm going to get you a bed, and place me into the hospital for care.
I was Totally Blessed by Being Lucky Enough to Get That Doctor.
Other than that; I've Got Nothing Nice to Say About UCD."
"I recently was diagnosed with a heart condition. I had chest pains through the night and into the next morning. I was unable to see my doctor and was advised to go to the ER.  I did.  Where I sat for 7.5 hours...without being seen.  I had an EKG, blood work and X Rays.  I was never seen.  When I was called for a third check of vitals I burst into teas and  told them I’m obviously not in danger and I’m going home.  I can not believe UCD treated me so dismissively.  No communication.  No concern.  Ridiculous.  Shame on you."
"Always professional... Siniffed out my mystery pain, diagnosed me, and saved my life... AGAIN!"
"I can't vouch for the quality of the medical attention due to the absolute LACK of courteous attention. We sat and waited over 5 hours and the only attention we got was a blood pressure check (the nurse left it wrapped on her arm so long that her arm became purple!) and her temp. Parking was $5 door 2 1/2 hours, and almost non existent. At the end of the first $5, I was informed that a different parking area was free for 6 hours. Circling the area for parking was tedious. Took me about 30 minutes to find a spot. On a very light medical emergency say it would still be a challenge to park due to the limited spaces made available. If I HAD to go to Davis Hospital I would go in an ambulance.
After many hours of waiting, I went to the cafe. At first I thought this was a bright spot in a certain dingy place. I ordered a cheese burger and fries. After a 15 minute wait, at the cashier, there was a sign that said nothing larger than a $20 will be accepted. All I had was 2 $50 bills. They said to go to the gift store for change. Again refused. By now the WAY overdone yet cold gray burger wasn't edible. I guess they would rather serve it to another customer or toss it out. I would refuse it if it we're free! We eventually walked out of the hospital without any medical attention by ANY doctor. I would recommend going ANTWHERE else for any addliction greater than a scratched knee.
It was also very hard to find. Not a fair amount of of directional signs. I change my stars to -2."
"Thank you for doing everything possible. All the employees I dealt with were competent, helpful and caring."
"Best hospital by far in the area it's worth it to drive a little farther to get the excellent service, care, kindness, but very knowledgeable, professional, everything you come to expect and love about a nurse, doc, and hospital! THE BEST OF THE BEST! THANK YOU UCDavis hospital keep up the good work,.."
"Every part of my 3 day experience at this hospital has been slow and torture. The nursing staff has been good to me but every part of this process is slow and painful. I came in in pain and it seems you have to sit and let your pain get way worse and complain non stop to get anywhere here. Came in pain and still in pain and haven't eaten in 22 hours so now I'm hurting and starving. Ready to leave without getting my results or getting fixed.

Updat 6 months later on top of my horrible personal experience with this hospital. My girlfriend has been sick for months with a pucc line in her arm and it gets inflected and the don't treat her for itbor do anthing about it. Every experience with this place has been bad. She has been called by her dr and told to come in 3 time in the last 2 days only to be sent home with a blood infection. Then they call hours later and ask her to come back 3 times now in 2 day's. They dont have anything together at this hospital"
I wish every doctors office was as good as this one. Check in was less than 10 seconds and our care was 100% authentic. Everyone there obviously shows a true interest in patient well being. The spine center office is absolutely fantastic and I cant thank them enough for everything they do.
"This is a terrible medical system! They would wait for you to near die or very emergency before they would take care of you.  I almost lost my daughter because of their corrupted procedure. My daughter got a kind of cancer but it took them one year from the time they discovered a suspicious article in my daughter's chest until they confirmed the cancer that already gone to stage of 4.  And myself got back pain, it took me several months to live with my severe pain that made me cried out every night without sleep.  They just preferred me from this doctor to that doctor or treatment.  Every time preferred, it took months to schedule appointment but mostly I just met the doctors 15 minutes with some talks but not thing helpful!  I do not trust this medical system at all!"
"UCD Med CENTER  provides the best possible medical care one can find in the Sacramento area, and has the best emergency & Trama center in the area. They have outstanding medical clinics."
"Dirty waiting room, used bandages and cotton swabs on the chairs. Homeless people laying everywhere.
Slow service, I saw them looking up lunch online instead of helping us."
Worst receptionists you will find. They go out of their way not to answer their phones and will leave you on hold upwards to an 40 minutes.
If I could rate this hospital a negative stars I would. I was sent to this ER by my doctor. I have a life threatening infection on my Mastoid bone. I wait for 12 hours with no word. When you asked how much longer they give you the same answer to every question I don't know. This is by far the worst hospital I have ever been to.
"So far my husband  has been in this hospital  far over a week, no surgery  on his fractured  tibula. Lots of excuses. I know its a trama hospital hospital  and life and death come first, but this is unbelievable! This morning  orthopedics  looked at him at 5:30 am, OK  for surgery  then brought  breakfast. I don't  think the right  hand  knows ehat the left is doing. Very  angry  to say the least"
"I will Never recommend the Emergency room. Etc etc etc. All they do is ""wear-out""/use your benefits!! We were helped BUT most of the the service was BS' repeating the same questions and answers and waiting in different stupid rooms.... RIDICULOUS! At least Urgent Care doesn't take dat'longgg!!!!!"
I had strabismus surgery done here when I was no more than 6 years old. For years doctors here told me I'll never be able to see correctly without glasses again. Here I am now I'm almost 19 and hey guess what? Proved you guys wrong. My vision is now perfect 20/20 and all I did was get lasik at a place across the street from a taco bell. I'll have a special place in my heart where I will resent this business for telling me my vision will never be fixed. Ha! Sike my life is great and I can see now no thanks you you guys and your strong words of hope.
I have a PPO. They still want to play get a referral...
"The absolute worst!!! I am shocked at this being a “UC MEDICAL HOSPITAL” are we in a 3rd world country? It felt like a greyhound bus station. If you want to come to die, I suggest this place. 10 hrs wait time and they are still checking vitals? Then they get offended if you ask as your are slowly losing consciousness."
Kidney failure patients DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME  at this place trying to get on the transplant list!!! Go to Virginia Mason in Seattle even if it costs you five times more!!  UC Davis has nurses that barely speak English.  They have a psychiatrist there that has feminist issues and hates men. They just like to bill Medicare for fake workups and put people on the list that have private insurance. Run for your life.
"The worse service if you want to die go to UCDavis to the ER
My husband need to have an small intervention dr saw him he was nod feeling well send him to the ER for evaluation we are waiting for almost  5 hours
Very disappointed UCDavis the only I heard you have to wait wait and wait
You must die before they can see you
My husband is shaking feeling very sick didn’t eat because he supposed to have small intervention but you have to wait
All I heard revalue revalue patient no more
We are busy you have to wait and die so we can see you"
"I have an infection in my left leg. Doc Pereira removed femur bone hardware and knee replacement from my leg. A 5hr surgery turned into an 8hr surgery. Doc Pereira not only saved my leg he saved my life. I could stop there, but there is so much more. The nursing staff are the most compassionate and cari Jonng nurses in the world,  plus the most professional nursing staff.  I want to thank Sara,  Tina, Anna, Melinda, Jennifer ,Rodney, Charan, and Apollo! Your the best of the best.  I also want to thank the PIcc line techs, your the best. You all made my stay a loving and awesome experience. See you all in 5 months when I get my knew knee! Sincerely Adam DeTro."
UC Davis Med. Center is GREAT.Thank U for helping my husband so quickly. Jeri S..
"Twenty-five hour Emergency Department wait for a room for a terminal patient. Good  nursing care, but young and no leadership.  Some are of the opinion that the patients are here for them. There is no shortage of staff. Eighth floor night shift actually had a party in the middle of the night on 5/10/2019.  Incompetent management and administration. Plenty of alphabet behind their names makes for high salaries but completely lacking in administrative ability.  James F. Fothergill"
"I cannot say enough good things about this hospital.BUt it was good..... helpful and beautiful,"
"On one of my trips to Intel Folsom, I got very sick and then hospitalized for a week. The UC Davis Medical Center is an excellent hospital. My initial care in the emergency department was thorough, even though it took about eight hours. The hospital staff were kind and professional."
Fast efficient service
"My doctors are at this location,, and there great because I had to transfer from woodland to sacramento location, and didnt have any issues with paperwork or transcript"
Two star 🌟 for an over all medically great no issue with surgery and great physical therapy but nurses could be better some nurses will hold my one year olds nose 👃 to make him swallow his medicine and it caused him to inhale it instead and his reaction was to throw up all his food and medicine and the same nurse has done this to my son's roommate i genuinely believe that he was choking on the medicine that was being given to him DO NOT LEAVE YOUR KIDS ALONE HERE also as a side note do not allow your kids to fill out any survey it cold end with them in the mental institution if the check yes to past depression
Loved it! Will definitely stay again on my next trip through Sac. Hope the pool and hot tub renovation if finished on my next visit.
"If I could do a zero I would! This place is garbage. I was hospitalized for a surgery ,nurses didn’t attend to me for hours, the doctors lied about coming to see me. My nurse was dingy as hell. My roommate was appalled at how I was being treated. I told the nurse I had to use the restroom but the meds where making me dry, try having your bladder almost burst, when your crying in pain, I yelled at the staff and said is this how you treat people, I’ve been calling hours the nurse said we are here now or u can go home, I couldn’t even walk and this nurse started grabbing my things. Don’t have surgery there I had a small surgery , my gallbladder removed and have been in pain since. I’ve been back there three time in the past week, never seen, waited 5+ hours. There was a poor woman screaming, she was clearly sweating, in and out and in pain, this way like literally 48 hours ago and the nurses walked by like nothing. They didn’t even try to comfort her. UC Davis sent my son home when he was having seizures, this place is a dump!"
"Great hospital. Clean. High technology. Friendly nurses. You might have to wait for a while but it's worth the wait..
"" Better safe then sorry"""""
My husband is being treated here for his cancer and always get excellent care! Love UCDMC!
"The star is for for the positive experience my family had with a few of the physicians and mostly disrespected nurses.  Unfortunately, several of them moved away..  One was and is a great doctor, but his partner is absolutely awful.  I am writing this regarding a terrible experience we had years ago with my middle child.  She was almost 3 years old and had been running a fever of 102+ for 3 days at that point. Our doctor was not in, so we were seeing and communicating with his location partners.  One evening her breathing was irregular and the temperature was climbing, even with medication. I knew something was terribly wrong and called after hours. I received a call back from the on call partner.  I told her what was happening and she told me to continue what I was doing and maybe get an appointment the next day.  That didn't feel right to me and I emphasized that her breathing was not right.  This woman had her healthy children playing and laughing in the background, and she sounded exasperated for my reiterating my concern, and asked me, ""what do you expect me to do, come over and hold your hand?"".  No joke, she actually said that.  I told her, hand holding was not necessary, but I would like for her to behave like a doctor and give advice and direction.
I went to emergency, who admitted my daughter to pediatric ICU for what became a full week stay because she had developed a very bad pneumonia, and one lung had collapsed.  It has taken years for me to write this, because I still get tears when I think of that horrible situation and how that doctor made it so much worse.
So, here is the rotten cherry on top.  I did not want another parent to go through what I had gone through and so I contacted member services, or whatever it was called to inform them of what had happened.  The woman I spoke with was very cavalier.  She pretty much asked if my daughter had been treated, to which I said yes, after I had to make a decision on my own to take her in.  She then repeated what the doctor had said.  She literally said, ""well, the doctors can't come and hold your hand, you have to..."".  I hung up, because I had already been through a horrible ordeal and there was no compassion, no hint of empathy.  It was awful and because of these people and run ins with a number of haughty, do lots of wrong, elitist attitudes of staff and doctors, we left UC Davis.
Incidentally, that was not the only horrible incident.  On another visit I miscarried in the restroom while waiting for service in the emergency room.  No one was there to help and the police officer on duty came to help me wrap my baby in paper towel, his eyes teared up some.  A nurse came by when he called her over, she unceremoniously took the baby, mumbled sorry, or something and took off down the hall.  I never saw that nurse or my baby again.  They are very good at causing long term trauma to families.  Awful does not begin to describe it."
"They keep you waiting in the ER for like twelve hours and they don’t tell you it’s going to be that long. Had they communicated that upfront with would have went to another hospital. Then when you complain most of the nurse have an attitude and blow you off. The waiting room is super uncomfortable yet they expect you to sit there over night. It’s bad enough that folks aren’t feeling well, least they could do is make it conducive to twelve hour stays. It took me six hours to get a nurse to give me a Tylenol and ice for my hand. Avoid this ER, it will be a miserable wait they don’t give a damn."
I love ucdavis point blank
"UC-D needs help with lots of areas of patient care, from scheduling, to medical records, to communication, to accurate diagnoses.  It may be good for the physicians and there may be really good departments, but a lot goes wrong here.  I am new to Sacramento area and was expecting a smaller version of UCSF.  Not at all.  I don't know if it's funding, leadership or something else but lots of things need to be improved.  I hope that it happens because the Sacramento area needs and deserves top specialty care."
Horrible horrible doctors. I thought maybe coming to UC Davis I would get more answers then going to my regular Gridley hospital well NOPE!!! I can’t believe they don’t know there medications either.
"Our son was born premature to the hands and care of the Doctors, nurses, and staff of UC Davis Medical Center.  Our baby is currently in NICU.  If I could use one word to describe all those involved of taking care of the women and babies in this Hospital,  it would be - ""Angels"".

The health care providers at UC Davis have far and beyond exceeded our expectations for the best health care services.

I will be forever grateful to them all.

Big hugs from Michael Urbina/Dad

"This place is awesome for cardiovascular heart surgery. Dr. Southard and Natasha the RN did an amazing job saving my moms heart, and her life! They care a lot about people and take their time to explain everything. Thank you guys for all your hard work and knowledge. We really appreciate it!"
This hospital is to notch for teams injuries and surgical procedures. My daughter had 2 extensive heart procedures at UC Davis medical center and I don't have one negative thing to say about the medical staff there. Amazing surgeons! Amazing nurses! And Amazing social workers!!! Highly recommend this hospital...
"Has to be about the worst hospital I’ve ever been to. My sons appendix ruptured and it took them 3 hours after the ultrasound to get him seen by a doctor. It took them even longer to get him pain meds.the surgeon was great but the nurses are terrible. They are very unsympathetic and rude. A male nurse named Sean on the 6th floor kept trying to force my son to walk even though you could tell he was in agony. Another nurse Lynn pulled my sons earphones out of his ear because he wouldn’t talk to her. I guess she didn’t understand that he’s 5 years old, not feeling too great, in an unfamiliar place with unfamiliar people.  The stay is also uncomfortable. The rooms are separated by lousy curtains which make for no privacy at all. I do not recommend this hospital."
"The worst medical Center that I have ever seen,
I have been waiting for 7 hours,  nobody care about you. Before this Center was great, but now the worst"
Been in the ER complaining of severe chest pain for 14hrs still haven’t been seen by a doctor. So much for compassion...
If you willing to die go to UC Davis emergency roomWorst treatment people there don’t care if you die as simple as that.
Waiting room stinks and very dirty the house keepers never seen clean this lobby waiting up more germs being thrown around this place can be better and kept cleaned seems country jail waiting lobby ya k
"If there were 50 stars I'd give'em 52. The nurses and Dr's here are very,very kind,they act like they really love and care about you. They really take care of the patients,I'm sure that somewhere in this place there are Dr's preforming miracles,just because I haven't seen it doesn't mean it's not happening"
Protocol robots with no empathy
"I've been calling and calling, waisted almost of my halfday calling but no one's answered, it went directly to voicemail and says...cannot leave a voice mail because it's full!!!...What kind of hospital is this??? No receptionist to answers calls???"
Some of the best care in Northern California... IF you have the right insurance
"Waiting to be seen in ""fast track""area here 3hours took them 2hours to register my daughter. Their setup sucks, had to come to e.r. cause every year they change what type insurance they accept my daughter has a chronic disease they don't seem to care. Time to switch to KAISER"
"WE WENT THERE MY COUSIN WAS ADMITTED . ( THE DIAGNOSIS WAS SOMETHING WE ALREADY NEW ?,) HE GOOFY ! LOL."
"I will always love uc Davis hospital here I been treated well taking care ones of my favorite doc is victor Rodrigues , Lisa brown , Jennifer Maxine , farwell,Teresa yenk,James , Pan Chong,demises, Giannini,Tanya and my funny man  evansssss Christopher paul❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏thanks to all the nourses and everyone in uc Davis I will always thanksfull with you all .uc Davis deserves more than just 5 ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ They are the reason for me writing ✍️ this . It may not mean a lot for them but I want to let everyone in uc Davis how thankful I am 💙💚💛❤️💜"
"helpful and beautiful, if you want to learn new  medical thing , just come here and u won't regret."
"Have been coming to UCD doctors for years. The Dr's,  nurses and medical assistants are the best. The best specialists in the world.  Love my primary care doctor."
Great staff caring for my mom while she has surgery. Good hospital
"My 4 year old son is able to fight cancer because of this hospital. All of the nurses in davis 7 are amazing!! My son loves them. Their work is great even when they are tired. Heidi, Amy, Katie, and both Angelas you are awesome!!!"
"Two stars because of the nurses. They are kind and work very hard. I had to switch to another provider because I couldn't get the care I need. Through my new provider I was able to see my doctor the next day, she listened to me, made a follow up appointment while I was in her office and called me later that day with the information I needed. The difference in care is like night and day. I would recommend looking elsewhere if you actually have medical concerns. I didn't trust the doctor I saw at Davis to look out for me at all. All follow up calls were through assistants and she never read my chart. I know doctors are overworked, but it is your health, so find someone competent in spite of that."
Day 11 in MSICU Blue tower 7. Beyond exceptional care from nurses and all staff for my daughter who was brought in on a Ventilator and on day 10 was up walking with help! Thank God for these selfless angels
"Absolutely unacceptable, disrespectful, and doing an injustice to their patients. I came in because I had just lost a lot of blood. I was taken into the back and blood was taken to be tested. After 5 hours of waiting in the lobby I asked how long it would take and was met with a rude challenging attitude which is unique for this region. I felt like I was back in time. I asked if I could at least have my test results and was met with a further rude and challenging attitude and told I would still be billed for services if I left even though I was not able to see my own test results.

EVERY PERSON IN THE LOBBY WENT BEFORE ME AND THEN SOME. Either they were profiling me for being middle eastern, or messing with me. I had asked to speak with a manager and was told they would be out in 15 minutes. after waiting much longer, I eventually left and went to Sutter where I had to wait another few hours, but at least they had the decency and humanness to be respectful and acknowledge my questions. GO TO SUTTER OR ANYWHERE ELSE!

Oh and also worth noting the bathrooms are barely usable. The Men's bathroom's stalls had the locks broken off, and the sink sprayed a TON of water on me an I came out soaking wet. They seem to be going for the jail feel rather than hospital."
The only hospital that my husband will go to have saved his life a couple times. I really don't like to use the pharmacy at the main hospital. Like to use the ACC pharmacy. Nicer people
Great quality care very kind the patients and family they treat you like family
"If you choose to go, make sure to bring a sleeping bag. Had to take my mom to Kaiser after waiting 5 plus hours in the ER without receiving any results back from her blood test. Not only us but there were MANY others waiting just as long if not more"
Research and studies are pretty good they need to listen more to the patience other than that nice place.
"I sat in here 2 hours shorting breath so I just left. I figured if I'm gone die might as well do it at home.. Never again! The waiting room was empty upon arrival and they said all the rooms in the back were full. But as the waiting room filled and patients who were in the back was being discharge. I started to see that there triage is pretty much crappie and I have nothing good to say about a hospital  that allowed me to sit for over 2 hours short of breath, a rash on my neck, joint pains, and a dry cough. When I asked the nurse what's going on she said you are talking fine. I was like so are all the people who came after me that yall have seen prior to me.. The killer part was they didn't even do blood work while I wait.. They did no diagnostic tests."
"The service here is comical at best and breaching your privacy as they discuss your case in front of other patients at worst. This place is run like the show Scrubs. I saw people playing in wheelchairs and my needs were outright ignored. I could barely walk and not a hand nor wheelchair was offered. I felt like I was going to pass out and was left sitting for hours. I had blood squirted all over my dress in a botched IV attempt. I complained of unusual and frightening amounts of tingling in my arms and legs, even at the end of my visit. My doctor's answer? I'm not in life threatening danger so it's not thier problem.

Do NOT come here if you can help it. Pick a different medical center."
"Security's almost as bad as TSA....
The intrusion's irritating, but it makes for a better smelling & less crowded ER waiting room."
"I was involved in a motorcycle accident on 2/10. The psychiatry dept. at UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento spent LESS than 3 minutes interviewing me, in extreme pain--broken leg, ankle and ribs, including major lacerations-- and came up with an outrageous diagnosis that I was suicidal. I want to be honest here In the shape I was in ANYONE would rather be dead. I may have even uttered the word ""dead"", but that is NOT my point. My point is that it is now 5 days later, and this institution STILL has not released me. Since being incorrectly diagnosed as suicidal, one would think I would receive help, or therapy, or counseling. As of 2/16, I have been offered 0 minutes of therapy or help. As of 2/16 I have literally, and I'm not exaggerating  a bit, have had less  than 3 minutes conversation with psychiatry personnel. I've been cleared for release from the medical team, the physical therapy team, the trauma team, the primary team, the ortho team. Just one team is keeping me here--the psychiatry team. This insignificant team of individuals, who followed the advice of an inept man, who spent less than 3 minutes evaluating a traumatized patient, who was just involved in a freeway motorcycle crash, have all together spent less than 5 minutes trying to improve my condition or re-evaluate my condition. If you have any prior mental condition do not come to this place, you will greatly regret it. If you think you need psychiatric help in any way shape or form, do not come to this place because you will not receive the care you desperately need. For all practical purposes this hospital does not have a psychiatry team, it is merely a formality."
"Came from Reno in a crises and left with a solid treatment plan and feeling heard. We were in and out of the ER in 2.5 hours. From the Nurse to the Doctors, all were knowledgeable and treated us with great respect"
"I would rate excellent but the housekeeping staff are not on their game. My daughter has been in the hospital for three days and there is sticky stuff on the door to her ward. The room is clean because i demanded they clean it. The medical care here is excellent, I trust them to take care of my baby and get her back to health. I've been at other hospitals with rude doctors and who just suck at their jobs. Not the case here but they really could do a better job keeping the place clean."
"A mixed bag, mostly excellent staff but admin is HORRIBLE, pt.experience going downhill"
"My teen  daughter was shuffled around from specialist to specialist. No follow through, no consistancy, and no communication. We have hundreds of medical records, and each one contradicting the next. They've made our life hell. They threw out one diagnosis, and gave up. Biggest regret? allowing it to go on as long as I did. ( I can thank C.C.S. for that) She can't get those years back. The best Doctor's we'd seen there, had left, not surprised. The one star, is for the Nurses, who almost always save the day."
"Unethical doctors and nurses! A family member's feeding tube was removed off without doctor's permission, and when investigation was done by concerned family members, the morning nurse who took the feeding tube off blatantly lied and said the ""patient took it off"". Imagine that! Thankfully Charge nurse confirmed that it WASN'T the patient who took it off, but it was the morning nurse! Little do these incompetent staff at UC David Medical Center know that the patient involved is a very important person, patient is loved by a huge community and a very loving family! One thing for sure, lawyers are lined up and there's a serious lawsuit in the works, this is solely for one reason only, and that is to prevent other current and future patients to go through this same horrible experience.  Shame on the doctors and nurses at UC Davis! See you in court, everything is documented and detailed!"
The best Medical Help services Equipment and Experience Technology Doctor's that know there stuff great food kindness and Helpedful they know 👌 best Clean Environments in and out of this establishment😀 100% . × Over
"I am a chaplain student at U C Davis. The program is excellent and the patients, nurses and physicians are terrific."
"Had a good experience in the ER.  It was very crowded and busy, yet, when we were seen, the staff took care of my Niece very well.  I am a Kaiser patient, and would consider UC Davis as my hospital.  Parking is expensive, though."
Horrible food sevice and very clumsy/undependent nerces tripping on courds. so far the worst hospital I've ever been to in my life
The Drs. and nurses are great. Very clean room. The only thing that I didn't like was their food. OMG. Horrible. It looks and tastes like it's processed and frozen. Just awful. I've been in quite a few hospitals and if they gave a Raspberry Award for hospital food - this place would win.  Just isn't healthy food.
"In a short time I have met this place 3 times, Everything is great in here, doctors, nurses and the medical assistants, thy really taking care of people from any region which is great, thank you so much guys"
"This hospital reminds me of a 3rd world hospital, patients in chair strewn all over the floors, patients crying/screaming from their rooms, etc while staff is standing around at the nurses station watching some video on their cell phone.  I had the unfortunate aspect of having surgery at this facility, my family actually came in and got me discharged as they were very concern that the lack of patient care was going to kill me.  UC Davis has a abnormally high rate of post-op deaths, complications and complaints as compared state and nation-wide.  Figure UC Davis are just a bunch of public employees and they act like it, my stay at UC Davis was like having healthcare passed out by a DMV employee.  UC Davis' lack of post-op treatment and care caused me a blood-clot and ensuing heart-attack. If you care for your loved one who is unfortunately needing medical care, get them transfer to a different medical facility else guarantee UC Davis will do more harm than good."
"Terrible! And I really hope someone from communications can contact me since no one else in the hospital will. My son was just discharged after being on UC Davis 7 ICU for 3 weeks. We live in Washington and had to travel 10 hours back after discharge. We were assured that his medical records were forwarded to his PCP. They were not! Myself and the doctor have been faxing over and over calling over and over. The lazy lady that works in medical records still is not responding and claiming she isnt getting them. Though we've confirmed the number and put STAT on it, still nothing. Our son had a DEADLY syndrome. He is still going through symptoms. We NEED UC Davis to forward his history, but they wont. They will only accept faxes. Who f'n faxes anymore??? UC DAVIS needs to provide an email!! My son could die if he doesnt have the care he needs and our doctor cannot know what care to provide when he doesn't know the history of the blood work and tests done. Also, during a few of my sons blood transfusions and dialysis treatments, several of the nurses in Davis 7 attempted to access my sons PICC line without gloves or mask. Seriously dangerous!! No charge nurse addressed it after we reported it. So clearly the nurses have each others back instead of the patients."
"Dr. Eric Giza at UC Davis, has all the credentials and accolades of and Orthodics foot surgeon but the outcome of his surgery performed on my left heel/arch and Achilles tendon says differently.  He was highly nominated by many within but the outcome of his services was as if a novice surgeon performed the surgery. I initially sent reviews of his pre-op office visits as being very knowledgeable.  Was I surprised of the outcome. Reason, The foot surgery was billed for $82,000
Dollars alone. This did not include the two CT's and two MRI's plus countless X-Rays, equipment and Office visits pre & post surgery. I highly questioned if he performed this surgery given it's a teaching hospital and the outcome even if he signed off on the surgical report. My left heel and arch is worse then prior. The heel is collapsing inward and arch is fallen. The 7 inch scar by the arch throbs and is numb all the time. The outer heel has 2 two inch scars which is numb and causing extra pressure on the incision.
The Achilles' tendon next to the heel is facing inward and he left a two inch incision in the back of my left calf. I have limited blood flow and the  Achilles' tendon and calf is throbbing 24/7 to include being numb. It wakes me up all night. My foot locks forward when laying down and is numb 24/7. Even with compression socks there is no relief. It's extremely painful to walk on the foot. I have severe muscle atrophy in the left calf due to his incision on in the calf to lengthen theAchilles tendon.   I also developed two DVT's in the left calf. It's difficult to stand flat on the foot also due to the Achilles lengthening. I cannot walk on a bare floor due to the pain. My foot is twisted in such a way that the ball of my big toe hits the floor first causing extreme pressure under the ball of the foot. I have special Orthodics to raise the foot given at Travis AFB. It's causing extensive back pain without them.
Upon many visits to his office post operation he sent his in turn doctors to evaluate. They say by x-ray it looks great. I stated the outcome show different. I requested Dr. Giza's presence on my last appointment a few wks ago and his comment was let's take more CT's and see how we can fix this. Upon two outside evaluation from Travis AFB and the Veterans Administration both confirming that Dr. Giza performed a sloppy left foot surgery.  It was highly recommended by both outside sources to have a re-surgery to fuse the heel in place to hold it straight and remove the plate and screws from the prior surgery that will straighten the arch.  Otherwise I will be in further pain and not be able to walk in the future. I also meet a man and women at the clinic post op stating they also had a huge problem with there foot surgery performed by the same doctor. In my evaluation this is a cash cow operation with poor results. Reconsider your options prior to visitation his clinic for foot surgery.

No one answers the phone. I've been calling for 30 minutes. Horrible.
"Godsend, the Dr.s and staff at the burn specialists dept.are a true heaven sent. Thank You."
"You have to try the banana cream pudding! It's like a Twinkie, only fresh and made with vanilla wafers. A cool treat for a hot day. (Also, recommend the pureed mechanical soft diabetic cardiac renal diet.)"
"Just to say yes, but need directory/phone numbers."
Was seen yesterday in OBGYN department to have emergency D&C. Everyone was nice and very informative to my spouse. Procedure was done at time scheduled. Received great service from the staff in this department.
"Mediocre at best.  Many of these doctors will aim to pull as much out of you money and insurance wise and will not address all your concerns.  Appointment times are capped and you are only allowed to be seen for a couple of concerns, no matter how quick you present the information and  no matter how well prepared you are.  Some these doctors are very dismissive and will not provide you with proper care or even compassion.  I have found that most of the doctors that I have came across have had poor bedside manners and simply come across as they can care less.  They are very opinionated and do minimal work and will brush-off concerns no matter how much reason you give them to at least order you a test.  I pay out of pocket and have insurance to cover these very real concerns and I hit a brick wall in trying to ensure that I am receiving healthcare that I am satisfied with.  I am not asking for over the top requests and god forbid anything cutting edge (although I do my research on these things).  This place has loss my respect.  They have a lot of so called entitled doctors that will provide mediocre work and make hundreds if not thousand for a few minutes or even an hours worth of work.  Sure that is vague but my point is that the healthcare and results does not equate.  I should have stayed with Kaiser.  However, I will be ending my medical relationship with them.  If you want competent, ethical care, this is not the place.  I found that may of these 5 star review are far and few in between and look at the 3 star reviews for a better idea.  Sure not all my visits have been horrible but overall my experience has and I have been dealing with them intensively over the last few months.  I am very disillusioned at this point where how bad healthcare really is or can be at least at UC Davis."
UCDMC always treats me very well. The wait in er is sometimes long but the staff do their best to get me in quickly. UCD is tops in cardiac care!
My brother was recently admitted to this hospital 08/05/2016 and his property was stolen/misplaced during transport/ emittance. I would recommend not going here if you want to hold on to your personal effects. At a time when your trying to heal and get better. you shouldn't have to worry about your personal items not being returned to you after checkout. Terrible customer service and just pure negligence. Will not be returning ever!!
a lil long for me but they r really good
"I just recently changed insurance providers,I would rather have to wait some time than to go thur what i was going thur with my other insurance, Kaiser They are more professional and you actually feel they care about people an  I was checked for a possible heart problem which i am pretty sure kaiser would have bothered to do so,in the past they didnt and i have  had an stroke  before,I,m actuallt relived and dont mind the waiting because i  know that they have good doctors there,i  dont think i would trust my life with an kaiser doctor seeing they left me with an tumior in my mouth 2 years and didnt  do  anything  about it,seriously I shouldnt be here,but, i would trust UC Davis doctors over them any day I dont think waiting is an problem when it comes to your health,are life At least they listen its more your  going to get from a kaiser er trust me they are very good er doctor at Davis."
Emergency room is awful it takes 4 hours to be seen and I have not been seen yet. One of the admin at the emergency entrance  has a really disrespectful attitude I was told if I Caint wait long enough to be seen I can leave.
doctors do not work. you can die five times. they deliberately destroy us. horror is simple. this can be in the most backward countries
THIS HOSPITAL SAVED MY LIFE. I AM FOREVER GRATEFUL FOR THE EXCELLENT MEDICAL TEAM AND PRACTICE THIS HOSPITAL HAS. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
The nursing staff/team on the Surgical ICU floor is awesome!!! My Mom & I are so happy with the care my Dad has been receiving 😊
"This place is really state of the art looking, very beautiful building and architecture, the views are nice also, and the care is amazing"
"Needs a lot of work. 4+ waiting time. My dad was on the verge of death and all they tell me we can’t do anything I was like I’m not asking for room just check him give Him some sort of medicine. Ridiculous, such a huge hospital should be a lot better."
Currently at the hospital since 8 am and was scheduled for a c section at 11:30. There are 2 OR rooms. Well I guess an emergency came up so my C section got pushed back. I'm sitting here being told at 1pm that the OR is being cleaned and prepared for me to go in. Then I hear the nurses saying to eachother nobody has even started cleaning. I kept being told I'm about to go in the OR then another nurse comes and tells me another emergency has come and I'll have to wait another 2-3 hrs. The doctor also came in after the nurse and just had a straight attitude. Im sitting here starving because they tell u not to eat past a certain time the previous day. I feel they are rude and I'm expecting to meet my daughter today and they tell me I can eat and leave and come back tomorrow if I want. This is total BS
"I have Cervical cancer and was referred to UC Davis. I got a phone call from them saying I needed someone there to drive me home after the leap procedure. They would call me back as soon as they got the authorization to make the appointment. I didn't hear back so I started making phone calls.
I called to see if it was authorized, which it was. I then called UC Davis, they told me I was denied. I called the referral person at the clinic  I go to and she informed me that UC Davis does it all the time to them, now.
I decided to call UC Davis to find out why I was denied.
I'm on MEDI-CAL now.  I was told because they had few doctors they did not take Medi-cal patients. They only had a lot of Residents but not actually doctors. I was also told IF I had different insurance they would do it!
I didn't realize UC Davis was a private hospital as big as they are. I could get an appointment right away and get the cancer cut out because it is a real easy, quick procedure IF I had a different insurance.
I was shocked! A little more than a pap smear.
I'm extremely disappointed in their policies!"
"I wish I could do a zero
This place is garbage.
I brought my mom to emergency room
nurses didn’t attend her we were waiting for over 4 hours , I ask if they have any idea of how much longer will take , and there response was
The longest people has to wait is 10 hours
But there was not to many people on waiting room , so I ask why that long is only 6 people waiting, and they said well there is more people inside a lot , but I knew that wasn’t true
they lied about it , they are very rude and unprofessional
This hospital is by far the worst hospital I have ever visited. We waited an excess of 6 hours in the emergency room.
And we got tired of waiting and left. We were among many that left because of the long wait time and rude staff. Staff made inappropriate comments such as ""this is not a doctors office!"" Shame of an excuse for a hospital.
Go to Sutter or Kaiser in this area if you have an emergency medical need.
this place is a dump!"
"After expending 9 hour plus, the doctors were not able to see me. Going to this hospital is not just expending the time but also the student who will practice on your health. I will never visit the place anymore and please don’t go there, your will really regret it"
Because they take better care of their patient
"I have brought all 3 of my children here for treatment for 6+ years. Cancer, seizures, pneumonia and even the swine flu. The team of doctors and nurses and very good. Children are a high priority. They do a great job prioritizing emergencies.

You do have to re-tell your story multiple times to whoever is asking you questions so that may cause you frustrations given you're already stressed. They prefer to test you and examine you thoroughly, then they would generalize a diagnose for you but will verify it afterwards. Registration comes to you, you will verify your info and sign 3 different forms to give consent for treatment.

I love the energy of their team, everyone is engaged and active. I'd considered the pace as rather fast. I've been in multiple ER and this one will have the highest number of team members tending to your emergency at arrival and then they'll disperse. This may be due to

They have lots of volunteers during the summer. Vending machines are new and accept credit cards. Sanitary bathrooms. Parking is free for 6 hours but you must log your plate number and vehicle make and model with security after your patient is registered into the system.

Cafeteria has great food. Amazing hospital honestly. My daughter had brain cancer and was taken care of successfully with back to back surgery. The nurses and staff are sympathetic and great with my baby. PICU is spacious. The PICU doctor that we saw,  Dr.Z, cares about our child and gave us a lot of reassurance regarding her experience.

If you do not have medical coverage, it is very expensive to come here. In 2010 I received a $21K bill for the ER for an xray from a car accident. My auto insurance policy covered up to 15K. Ambulance charges are about $5K to get here. $400 for urine pregnancy test which is just their protocol prior to being able to give any medication. $19K to use a stretcher not even placed in your own room. If you're covered, then you're good."
"My 3 year old granddaughter was sent there after she had fallen and had a bruise on her brain.   Surgery was two days ago.   My granddaughter has not been able to hold down food or oral medication.   The were going to discharge her anyway because nothing was being charted so doctors didn't know about the problems. This is a baby who has head trauma and had surgery.   We will be going home tomorrow and at 9:30 tonight , with no warning, the staff woke my daughter and granddaughter up and made them move to another floor.  Not professional or respectful. I would not recommend this hospital."
The doctors are top of the line and the nurses are amazing.
My MOTHER DROWED IN A POOL ABOUT 4 YRS AGO AND UC DAVIS SAVED HER LIFE.... I PRAISE ALL STAFF AND THOSE INVOLVED WITH HER RECOVERY 💜💛💚💙😘😘😘..... THANK YOU....
Pediatrics is garbage half them don't even care about the kids and most the nurses hold the child's nose etc while forcing medicine down there through and with 2yr olds makes them joke etc did so bad to my son he threw up everything he ate that when it was the first time he had eaten I'm 2 in days he is now traumatized to take his medicine when we could do it just fine before she did that. And now they're doing it to our roomate. Also the kitchen is closed every from like 730 till 11 so you cant even eat dinner
"Emergency room sucks waited for
6 hours to be seen ,no one helped me figure out what was going on nothing . Would not recommend this hospital"
"The hospital, where doctors and nurses in ICU tell their patients blatantly that they are dying! This conversation took place in the presence of the  patient's young children. Devil-like behaviour by Drs and nurse in ICU , thus causing trauma to the young children involved. So unethical, no respect  or dignity towards the patient! Shame on the ICU doctors and nurses who caused unnecessary trauma to both the patient and his children! How could you all sleep in the night knowing you hurt and traumatized my loved ones? Find another career since your heart is so black!"
F@#$ this place I give 0 stars but I can only give one
"All of the nurses, doctors, techs and staff have been fantastically caring and knowledgeable.  Thank you for helping my daughter feel better!"
"One of the worst hospitals Ive ever been to and Ive been to alot around the world, if there was less than 1 star then they would deserve it, greedy and care only about their pocket and not in enhancing their services, its such disappointing that a healthcare service that is build on caring for people actually is far from that, they completely ripped me off and never provided any services, my daughter had a minor accident with her arm when playing at the playground but was in crucial pain after a few hours so we took her to the ER at 9 pm, her health insurance was still in process so we had to put a down payment of 700$ before they even touched her, after making the payment we waited for 4 hours ( after 1 am) and apart from the painkiller medicine which they gave her to calm her down ( whole bottle available at Walmart for 5 bucks) we grew tired and frustrated of waiting without any1 to check up on her so we had to leave after 1:30 am, when we asked for our money back they refused to give it back as they stated they gave her a service ( checking her pulse and breathing the moment we arrived ) plus the medicine, all that for 700$ .. scam artists at the finest ...be careful when you check with them as they only care about whats in your pocket and care less about the service they provide for their patients"
"This place was horrible. Got to the hospital at 8:20 p.m. and wasn't seen till 3 am the next morning!! ER room was flithy, blood on the bed mattress in room D10, nothing was sanitized, floors were covered in trash, nurses wouldn't help until told at least 3 times, Doctors wouldn't go over X-rays before talking to the patient. My mother is completely 100% disabled, and needed immediate care ASAP but we wait 5 hours while the infections she had inflamed her left leg to the point of her skin bursting and bleeding. This is the worst medical facility I have ever seen, and dealt with."
Totally ignored in ER. Nurse said I needed a preg test so she ripped off my undies and shoved a bedpan under my butt. Then she left for over an hour. I had to wiggle it out and sit next to my pot of pee. I was hit by a truck so moving was very difficult. No drugs and no treatment later ...$35k! Not to mention the HIPPA violations. I heard all the gossip about the people next to me when the nurse did decide to grace me with her presence.
"Great care, not so good food. But great Dr 's with great skills,"
"If I could, I would give them a huge zeroooo 0. I was here for an emergency and had to wait for more than 6 hours. Worst service. The only thing they say is ""I Don't Know""."
Best patient care
"I have had many years of excellent care provided by UCDMC-PAVILLION HOSP & their various CLINICS throughout Sacramento, CA. Their doctors, nurses, techs, staff have ALL been A+.  Professional, Courteous, Kind & Dedicated. Lived/worked in San Francisco & Bay Area for over 50 years. My Ortho Specialist referred me to UCDMC in 2002 for my 1st TKA. I moved to Sacramento in 2007-2008 to continue w/my best health care ever! Thanks to All! RuthB"
It's the best the doctors are wonderful and everyone else
I love this place because my dad said he always just a help my dad
This is a horrible place..if u go in emergency pls plan to sit there for hrs with bleeding finger....it sealed  By it self after few hrs..No one cared.. worst experiencing ever..we been here for 4 hrs still no dr..horrible hospital..staff is rude when u ask for help..please go somewhere else..
My son was hospitalized.awesome staff especially Alex Jimenez in the 6 floor will never forget him
UC Davis is one of the premier Health Systems in Northern California. This is a Level 1 trauma center and can handle the most difficult medical-surgical needs of patients brought to it's doors.
Best service I ever had.
"The best medical facility that I have been to, I've been driving 3.5 hours for the past 3 years."
"I would give zero stars if I could. I was having really bad abdominal pain on my right side. I check into the ER at about 3am. I sat there in pain. Headache. Vomiting for for and a half hours before my boyfriend finally asked how long it was going to take. All they could say was other patients had priority. And I could be waiting for up to 8 more hours.
We ended up leaving and later that day I checked into Mercy General. Within 2 and a half hours I was seen by a dr. Had blood work and tests ran and was told I had to have surgery to have my appendix removed.
UCD has no respect or concern for their patients. The staff was rude and condescending as if I was faking my pain. Thankfully there was another hospital in my area who was professional and caring."
"I hope they do great research here. Because as far as helping people in immediate need, They deserve zero stars. They go out of their way to deny medi-cal/medi-care elderly patients.
Shame on them"
Worst emergecy room ever very inadequate.
I have been in this hospital for 7 years and it is amazing i never ever was board there and the staff is really nice there
Love how they are with my Dad as he battles cancer....awesome staff
Worst experience I have ever had at a hospital.  They communicate horribly.  If you break a bone do yourself a favor and go somewhere else because you'll be sitting around in pain for days on end.
I sat there not able to breath and shacking for 8 hours. Then I just left no one  Did blood work are anything just checked blood pressure .If you don't find waiting several hour sick then go ahead and go here.
"Ok people if you are a horrible person and you hate yourself then going off on other people is only going to make u sink deeper and deeper i hope some of these folks can have a change of heart but most will have to suffer ""karma"" ALOT to change anyways just here posting my experience of racist nirses saying natives are garbage and shes hates this and that ok im sorry you feel that way about yourself but if you could take a step out your prison you migjt have a whole new lease on life these hospital people are horrible but its just a basic error in human development being taken over and ran by your ego it can get nasty and all tjat ego stuff u do falls back on u cheers (boutta light up me a lil spliff of some ganja) there u go babylon."
"Ghastly ER ""service"" and ridiculous (11 hours +) wait times.  Indifferent and rude staff.  A sad and shameful testament to health care.  Someone needs to be held accountable."
This place is hell on earth 6 hours of waiting in pain having to listen to the ER nursers talk about there calorie intake and where they order there under armor. They actually made me sit in a waiting room with about 25 people in only a hospital gown. When I asked if I could please put my clothes back on she said they would call me soon. Over an hour later still sitting naked. Never had a Dr. go over my Xray results. Only even saw a Dr. for about 3 min. I finally got so sick of waiting and I left after the 6 hour mark. I would not recommend going to the ER here you would probably leave sicker than you came.
"swag hospital,
i like it. the parking was scarce thought. you feel my rhythm?"
"Everyone has raved about UC Davis so to get a second opinion I chose to go there. Sadly, I waited 5 1/2 hours while having fever/high blood pressure and severe right side pain while throwing up. After 4 hours I was impatient and cold in the lobby and went up front to ask for a blanket. The receptionist at the front was ignoring me for standing there so a security guard nicely approached me and asked if I needed help. I kindly told him I'm freezing and simply want a blanket, he turned to the lady that was ignoring me and asked her if I could have a blanket and she responded ""Hell no. We are just registration."" he rolled his eyes and went in the back to find me a blanket. She was not the only rude person up in registration area. A girl my age who was also waiting for hours and hours kindly asked how much longer until she would be brought back and the nurse at check in area responded ""I already told you! It's going to be a long night!"" It saddens me how rude people are that work in a hospital. Also while waiting for over 5 hours in the lobby there was two dangerous men on drugs that became violent towards others and had to be tazored by security guards. I did not feel safe, I was honestly praying while waiting. Finally after being brought back, I walked passed people in beds in the hall with no privacy - a males hand busted open and him getting stitches out in the open, a women screaming about drugs she was given, etc. when I got to my room with a curtain I was disgusted at all the blood all over the floor. When I saw the doctor I told the him how I had been in pain for three months and that I was desperate for a second opinion because my symptoms were getting worse and I was scared. He asked what the previous doctors had found, I told him - wish I hadn't. He just did the same tests I've already had done and gave me the same result. I was in tears all night. When I went to have a CT scan I didn't have a IV in me yet so the technician gave me one. Worst experience. I have never had anyone put one in crooked on the side of my arm and hit a nerve and also express a lot of blood. Earlier that night I had blood drawn no problem. All my life I've had blood drawn and many IVs placed no problems, when I told the lady that this one hurt she said ""nobody had ever told me that before"" and I replied ""well I have had plenty and this one was by far the worst"" she made me feel like I was exaggerating or not strong enough. Five days later my arm is still purple and bruised, I have never been bruised from a IV before. When I go into the machine for CT I notice blood all over the machine and point it out to her and told her how I'm a dental assistant so I notice detail of blood since I need to when I clean opportories. She wiped down some of the blood but still left some. When I was finished and went back to my room the nurse laughed at my IV and said how it is in the most uncomfortable place and hit a nurve. She took it out for me, I told her I would rather be re pocked then to keep that one in me. It's been 4 days and each day that area where I got the IV is more bruised and exteamly sore. My whole elbow is purple and my vein looks swollen. Lastelty the doctor came back to tell me my results - that all he saw was a cyst - that is what I told him I had and to please look for more than that because I have symptoms for other things. I cried and feel hopeless. Waist of time and money. Rude people that don't belong working in a hospital. I never got any pain medication to help with the pain. I felt dehydrated from throwing up/etc and was never given fluids. I'm disgusted with the amount of blood everywhere, also the bathrooms were gross - pubic hairs on the tiolet seats, urine down the tiolet and on floor, etc. this was the dirtiest building I have ever been in and sadly it was a hospital. I did not feel safe with all the crazies on drugs. I felt ignored and mistreated. That was my awful experience. I won't ever go back and I will make sure all my friends and family never go. Hope my review helps anyone else from waisting time and money too."
"This hospital is by far the worst hospital I have ever visited. I waited an excess of 10 hours in the emergency room. I got tired of waiting and left. I was among many that left because of the long wait time and rude staff. Staff made inappropriate comments such as ""this is not a doctors office!"" There was one girl there who was pale and was hacking her lungs out for at least 5 hours. No staff came to check on her although they could clearly hear her. Shame of an excuse for a hospital. Go to Sutter or Kaiser in this area if you have an emergency medical need."
"I cannot believe they charge for parking for outpatients, charging a captive audience of cancer and other patients is outright disgusting. Every dollar they can."
For an normal emergency i wait more than 12 hour. This is the baddest day of my life. I mean for an emergency it take more than 12 hour then guess how much will take for normal.
"You will wait a long time in the emergency room if you come in on a weekend or holiday (when most people seem to frequent ER's). That's the same with ANY county hospital. With that being said, the nurses and doctors at UCDMC are some of the brightest and most caring medical professionals in the world. The fact remains is that this hospital provides some of the best care in California. Trust me, if your life is on the line you want to be rushed here. They've saved my fathers life, and have taken care of me and my family for years. I have nothing but good things to say about this place. Sorry about the dirty bathrooms and tv volume and all the other crazy unimportant things I'm reading in these reviews, not one review about the quality or caliber of service they received on a real medical issue."
"'amazing' place ! I was went to emergency  for appendicitis,  I was waited more than 5 hours ! then someone came to asked how much you felt painful now. finally !!10 hours past!!  doctor came to take care of me. bad experience!"
Staff is professional and treats you well. They're very quick too!
"Best Hospital in Sacramento, just be patient with Emergency Department because it's always busy."
"The ER has patients sitting in the waiting room for hours, service is bad."
Fantastic staff and patient support!
Uc Davis 8 stem cell transplant nurses wonderful!! Saved my life
"I had tumors removed from my spine at UCSF. I was then sent to UCDavis for rehabilitation.  There physical therapists were wonderful, so kind,patient and helpful. The nurses on the other hand I were terrible. I had a very BIG, PAINFUL surgery and some days I waited hours for pain meds because the nurses did not answer my calls. I had wonderful care at UCSF and they sent all the info to UCDavis about what I should have and what I should be taking. It took the doctors and nurses 3 days to get it straight and control my pain. At one point I was crying from being in so much pain and a nurse actually stood in front of me arguing with me while I kept asking him to stop as I was still crying. If you need physical therapy and rehabilitation this is the place but if your in a lot of pain don't expect to get help."
"THEY RAN UP A LOT OF CHARGES AND PROVIDED NO HELP!  I tried to contest it with my insurance but they said UC Davis has to own up to the faulty charges.I asked they wont. This experience borderlines on fraud.

The allergist/rheumatologist (fellow) came in an hour late rude and agitated. I She lectured me 20 min about self referring. Which I did to expedite records being transferred from out of state. She told me she could tell I didn't have an autoimmune issue by looking at me and Id never develop one bc of my age. Awesome! Shes a seer or something.  She asked if I took vitamins. I said yes. She then lectured me for 20 min (ya I was ""lucky"" to have so much time with a doctor) about how there is an inverse effect with worrying about the vit you take and the food you eat. I wasn't aware I was worried about it. She told me I didn't have asthma. She could ""tell"", despite my 45 pages of medical history confirming that I did indeed have it .  I was lectured about taking prednisone.  She then reordered the test that were in records and didnt need repeating. So now I owe UC Davis for $800 for the visit and blood work.  She said I didnt have any of the things I have been previously been treated for for the last 20 years.

Their Orthopedic surgical is just as bad. They tried to cut my husbands bicep head instead of repairing a tear in his shoulder. The girl interning in that office hurt him by trying to put a injured shoulder through a full range of motion. We saw an excellent surgeon at Sutter.

If you don't mind being treated like cattle at a stock yard then this may be your place."
Horrible experience. Won't be back! And will tell my friends and family not to come here.
"save money ask about monthly , weekly and day parking passes because they won't tell you. The second month parking there I saved over $300 of obviously needed money. It's stuff like this that turns us into beggars even the doctors and staff.I understand the need for the revenue but not passing needed info is akin to lying when your down like that.  {{ this is to Kevin Moore below in the comments""I Know what your saying is Truth they even use the Delphi technique during the patient update meetings with the staff and doc's I feel sorry for some of the staff they recognise the BS and have to play. Stay Tuff and the cowards Will loose !!!!!!!!!! KICKEM when there down is there Mantra.
Just sayin
Bubbazametti
ps this is my third and final edit There are some UCD staff That are pure, PURE  Angels please please stay with it there your very much needed where you are."
life saving center with amazing staff!!
"It bothers me that  if it says emergency room means they will take u in fast, my child  eat something that he was alegic to he was intoxicated and I was there for 2 hours or more and never took me in so disappointed"
My sister came in due to heart failure..this place is filthy. The Drs do not wash their hand! Patients crying and screaming from their rooms at all hours.We discharged  her to be treated elsewhere. When a doctor tells you he prefers to do a procedure in an out patient setting instead of at this hospital because of bacteria...that tells you there's something wrong!
HORRENDOUS SERVICE. CAME IN AN AMBULANCE AND STILL HAD TO WAIT FOR HOURS IN THE WAITING ROOM AND WAS NEVER SEEN. EXTREMELY RUDE WOMAN AT THE FRONT DESK WHO CLAIMS TO BE A NURSE. DISMISSIVE TRIAGE NURSE. NOWHERE TO LAY DOWN. SEVERAL PEOPLE IN THE WAITING ROOM SAID THEY HAD BEEN WAITING SINCE THE DAY BEFORE IN THE AFTERNOON AND IT WAS 6 IN THE MORNING!!! AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE.
Wish I could give zero stars! Had the worst experience of my life!
"Great working staff, teaching hospital, best in Sacramento"
awesome place. ppl rly care
They really help me wit my pains..nurses were very helpful..an there doctors ask all the right..
"I have a little girl that have been running a fever for the last 3 days and I have been giving her tylenol and ibuprofen every 4 hrs as needed, she started to complain about the pain in her stomach and I called UC DAVIS because I thought that they would care, but I was wrong. My son have a Dr there but my little girls' Dr is somewhere else. They told me that she had to be a patience there in order for a Dr to call or see her even in the emer room> I found this to be bull---- because if a baby or anyone is sick they should be able to se a Dr @ any hosiptal exspecially if they can't help their self like handcap or babies. I see now that I was really wrong about us davis and from here on out I will not call them or even see anymore Dr there. I will change my son dr and my dr we will not use ucdavis any more. I also feel like if you don't have insurance you should be able to see some one, just like people that come from over the boarder they get to see dr and they are not patience any where.....I have insurance and so do my family so WHY do any one have to go throgh this..."
The Medical Staffs are friendly and professional and treat the people well.
"Horrible, rude and to be a hospital so dirty. They really slow and make you so long. I will never go there again."
The best care in Sacramento!!!  Dr Squires ENT is the best
"This is the worst UCDavis I have ever been to. Very poor service and rude staff. No one was at any of the front service desks, cashier didn't even know how to pull up my bill to pay, and the Cypress lab is very unclean will not be returning to this hospital for any future care."
This place has saved my life from cancer...
"peoeple were nice besides that they had no idea what they were doing, discharged me with out giving me  instructions, left the iv needle in my arm i had to go to someone to have it removed as they were going to let me leave with it in.
they cleaned none of my wounds after my car wreck and  on my paper work didnt even mention any of the things i told them were hurting on me i hope i never have to go back there again"
Awsome!! Saved my leg& saved my sons GF life!!
Don't see why you have a TV in a waiting area and the volume at 18. Then they ask you to turn it down. Then ask for the remote. Very snoopy people!
By far the best hospital I have ever been to!!!
It's not a emergency room that they have..They change it to WAITING ROOM been there twice at night in very bad condition but as usual after providing your name then you wait after 1 hour if lucky go to registration end number of stupid question then 2 hours later triage room again long list of question then wait for doctor which never end finally you will have to give up and go..When is asked why is taking so long iam in very bad condition they said usualy it takes 8 hours to 12 hours IDIOT..STUPID staff.don't ever go there
Great NICU.  Great care and medical staff
Best hospital  uc Davies  medical  centre
Lovely nurse and doctor
Excellent nursing staff
It's a hospital
Been in this hospital for five hours now.
The ER wasn't really packed but we had to wait 3 hours before we could be seen
This is a horrible hospital which should be blown up.
Ridiculous wait time and not very friendly or caring.
Complete f****** s*** I will never come back to this hospital again my doctor told me I had a viral infection after looking at me for 2 seconds didn't take the strep culture or anything then I get to Los Angeles about four days later vomiting not able to hold anything down my throat is ten times worse I go to a hospital down here and get proper treatment they gave me a CT scan take for blood cultures gave me liquid fluid IV and took a strep culture and I'm positive for strep f*** UC Davis I will never go back there again and I plan to make a complaint on the doctor that didn't help me I recommend going to Kaiser
They have the worst pharmacy ever. They're so slow.
"I went with my sister 3 times for emergency. We wait for 2 or 3 hours to enter the room and getting check up. Everytime, they said doctor is coming but they come after long time. So I agree with other people's who said that emergency room call is waiting room."
Saved me from Death
excellent
Thank You Everybody
mean attitude from help service
Had a 20 minute appointment in Dermatology specialists office and the bill was $900.  Can't afford to go back for the follow-up.
Cafeteria is quite decent
Great staff.
Worst place ever! Students get to practice on you!!!!
Iike here
"Filthy, filthy, place"
"There billing department really doesnt know what they are looking at.We were billed for tests that we never performed ,billing said was we have  investigated ,please contact the client to Dispute the bill.Think twice if you want to come here you might end up with a bill that isn't yours."
Top of the Line
One of the worst medical center in the California
Ridiculously.  Rude and not very caring whatsever.
Staff is fantabulous
Trying to reach my wife by phone is a MAJOR problem!
Your co payment may not cover your visit. Per the billing department your co-payment doesn't cover procedure done during you're office visit so you can count on having additional charges.  Only place I've ever seen like this. Basically if the Dr. does anything but talk to you they'll charge you for an additional procedure.
Remarkable.
good hospital
Such a bad hospital i ever been someone should wait at the emergency wating room for hours. I am waiting to see a doctor  from 1:00pm up to now....it is almost 2:00 am but still there is No doctor to see me.... no customer service...
I have been waiting for 4 hours to see a doctor in the emergency waiting area. I will never come to this hospital again.
best place ever
BAD BAD BAD
Greatest hospital in Sacramento County.^^^^
"Very bad.  Rudeness, arrogance, lost records, incorrect information. If you want ""care"" this is the wrong place to come."
Worst of the worst hospital ever go to!!!! WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOSPITAL!!!
They really need to work on phone skills.
best Spinal surgeons in the country
Bad all around.
I luv this hospital cause every time I see my primary doctor he doesn't know what to with me and I went to this hospital and they found y I was in so much pain all the time they diagnosed me with chromes disease and that makes sense
Perfect directions
Horrible in emergency  room long two hour wait to be seen.
This is a very  good hospital
Dirty waiting area and bathrooms for er .
The doctors and nurses
Super Hospital
spent 14 hours in the ER and still haven't been seen never coming here again next time going to Kaiser
"I have beeh in UCD Med center twice now, including right now. I have nothing but great things to say about the care, the staff, and the facilities."
This  is the best hospital
